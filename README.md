# Contracts

> Small collection of contracts

Some solidity contracts lives, then die. Instead of ending up deleted, and lost for ever, they should fall in the public domain, thanks to MIT. Feel free to take whatever you want. Donâ€™t expect any maintenance or support.

- [`Booking`](contracts/Booking.sol) was created for the [Crypto Comedy Club](https://cryptocomedyclub.co). It's not used anymore.
